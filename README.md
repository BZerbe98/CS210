Upload of project 2 for module 8 assignment in class CS210

1.) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    This is a compound intrest calculator for Airgead Banking, which helps to show people how their investments and money will grow over time.
    
2.) What did you do particularly well?
    I think I did good with seperating all the code into a few different files so main.cpp wasnt too crowded and slowed down. 
    
3.) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    I dont think there is one exact spot that needs improving to make this program better, but I do see a few places that I see a new way I could make it work since we       have learned a bit more in the course since working on the project. 
    
4.) Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    I think the hardest part was building the "formatting and spacing" around the numbers in the output. I think that is just something that will come with time,             trial, and error. I did have to look on Stack Overflow to see how others were doing spacing for similar things as I didnt fully remember how to. 
    
5.) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    Honestly I think every part of it will be. From the start to the finish it helped to show how to code a whole program. Sure it wasnt anything too crazy, but we all       start somewhere and this is something I'll be able to look back onto in a few years and see how much progress I made. 
    
6.) How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    comments, comments and more comments. Also I made sure to use spacing to keep lines of code seperated from others.
